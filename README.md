# PythonFinalProject
Python final project December 2021

When I initially decided to make checkers I vastly underestimated how difficult it would. I tried to fully do it on my own for about a week at which point I realized it was in vain. I learned about pygame and found it would be better to use than unity as I knew way more python unity (I know 0 unity), but since I have never used pygame before I still had trouble using it to it's potential. From there I found a guide on how to make checkers using pygame which I used to make the base game checkers. From there I made it my own by adding the different options the user has when first starting the game.

Despite not being able to completely do it on my own I learned a great deal. For one, prior to this i knew about the basic modules like random or time, but seeing how much pygame can do it made me understand the things they add to languages and it makes me excited for what I can do with other modules I hope to learn about. 

Even though from the outset it was very difficult to me after a little struggling I genuinely came to enjoy it. Me and a friend would just hop in discord him doing his residency applications and me this and just for hours we'd work, but it was fun. The problem solving part was also fun. For example, the king only mode was something I didn't think I would be able to do, but just a few hours before I turned it in I decided to try one more thing and it ended up working and the excitement I felt when I clicked run and it did was insane.

My original vision was to make a checkers game with some powerups and/or options I alone was able to make the powerups and options, but for the checkers part I needed a lot of assistance from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnd3RfeG3NM&t=484s
